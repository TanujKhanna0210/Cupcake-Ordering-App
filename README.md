# Cupcake
The cupcake app demonstrates the design and implementation of an online ordering app. 

The app consists of a home screen that shows an order screen with three options for cupcake quantities. Clicking an option takes you to a screen where you select a flavor, and then takes you to a screen to select a pick up date for the order. After that you can send your order to another app. You can cancel your order at any one of these stages.
